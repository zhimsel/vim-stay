==============================================================================
1. Introduction					*vim-stay-introduction*

vim-stay adds automated |View| creation and restoration whenever editing
a buffer, across Vim sessions and window life cycles. It also alleviates Vim's
tendency to lose view state when cycling through buffers (via |argdo|, |bufdo|
et al.). It is smart about which buffers should be persisted and which should
not, making the procedure painless and invisible.

==============================================================================
2. Configuration				*vim-stay-configuration*


VIEW SESSION CONFIGURATION:			*vim-stay-viewoptions*

The following, non-standard 'viewoptions' settings are recommended:
>
	set viewoptions=cursor,folds,slash,unix
<
It is recommended to clear the 'viewdir' contents after changing this option,
as it is only applied when creating a view session file, not when loading it.
vim-stay provides the |:CleanViewdir| command to do that.

Note that even if you would rather not change the other option flags from Vim‘s
defaults, you absolutely should remove `options` from 'viewoptions', i.e. do
>
	set viewoptions-=options
<
as storing local options in view session files causes no end of trouble.


IGNORED FILE TYPES:				*g:volatile_ftypes*

vim-stay applies heuristics to detect buffers that should not be persisted,
but in some cases non-persistent buffers slip through. Some of them are
regular files that are not persistent by their very nature (like git commit
messages), a few are buffers created by plug-ins that miss all indication
that they are not files. These can be expressly marked as volatile (meaning
buffers of this type will never be persisted) by adding their 'filetype' to
the `volatile_ftypes` global |List|.

Note this list is meant as a safety net for the case heuristics fail; it
usually should not be necessary to modify vim-stay's defaults. If you find
you need to add file types to it, make sure the plug-in has loaded, then do
>
	let g:volatile_ftypes += ['foo', 'bar']
<
ERROR MESSAGING VERBOSITY:			*g:stay_verbosity*

Because it is designed to work in the background of frequent Vim operations
(buffer view changes), vim-stay will suppress most errors and only echo
messages about important ones. You can adjust this policy by setting the
value of this variable to

	-1	echoes no messages for errors at all
	 0	echoes messages for important errors (default)
	 1	echoes messages for all errors

==============================================================================
3. Commands					*vim-stay-commands*


:CleanViewdir[!] [days]
		Remove all saved view sessions in 'viewdir', optionally
		keeping view sessions files not older than {days} days.

		Note: this will ask for confirmation before deleting files.
		Use the bang variant to bypass the confirmation prompt.

:StayReload[!]	Load new |vim-stay-plugin-api| integrations.

		The bang variant will re-load all integrations (not just new
		ones), clear and re-define the core autocommands as well as
		all |vim-stay-commands| and reset all global configuration
		variables (as listed in |vim-stay-configuration|) to the plug-in
		defaults.

==============================================================================
4. Variables					*vim-stay-variables*


b:stay_loaded_view
		Full path to the last view session file loaded for the current
		buffer. This value is not vim-stay specific and will only
		change when the loaded view file's path changes.

==============================================================================
5. Integration					*vim-stay-integration*


INTEGRATION WITH 3RD PARTY PLUG-INS:

Out of the box, vim-stay integrates with the following plug-ins:

1. vim-fetch	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5089
2. FastFold     https://github.com/Konfekt/FastFold

If you'd like vim-stay to integrate with other position-setting or view
management plug-ins, open an issue or a PR at

	https://github.com/kopischke/vim-stay/issues

If the plug-in in question is one you own or contribute to, see
|vim-stay-plugin-api| instead.


INTEGRATION API:

1. Keeping the position set by other scripts	*b:stay_atpos*

To make vim-stay respect a position set by an unsupported script or plug-in,
set the `stay_atpos` buffer-local variable:
>
	let b:stay_atpos = [lnum, colnum]
<
This position will be restored after loading the session.

2. Ignoring a file on a per-buffer basis	*b:stay_ignore*

To stop vim-stay making and restoring sessions for a specific buffer, do
>
	let b:stay_ignore = 1
<
See the |g:volatile_ftypes| user setting for a way to ignore all buffers of
a certain file type.

3. Autocommand API				*vim-stay-autocommands*

vim-stay triggers two |User| autocommand events each when loading or saving
state: *BufStayLoadPre* before loading a view session and *BufStayLoadPost*
after loading it, *BufStaySavePre* before saving a view session and
*BufStaySavePost* after.

4. Extended plug-in integration API		*vim-stay-plugin-api*

The mechanism vim-stay itself uses to integrate with other plug-ins is open
to 3rd parties. Add a file
>
	autoload/stay/integrate/yourplugin.vim
<
containing a `stay#integrate#yourplugin#setup()` |autoload| function to your
plug-in. Any function with that signature found in 'runtimepath' when vim-stay
loads will be executed. You can set up autocommands in there (which will
automatically be added to the `stay_integrate` autocommand group), optionally
leveraging vim-stay's autocommand API (|vim-stay-autocommands|), or add to the
volatile 'filetype' list (|g:volatile_ftypes|).

The advantage over hard-wiring support for vim-stay in your plug-in is that
- the integration will be set up when your user uses vim-stay regardless of
  plug-in load order, but
- the integration code will only be active if your user actually uses vim-stay.

==============================================================================
6. Troubleshooting				*vim-stay-troubleshooting*


MY CURSOR POSITION IS NOT PERSISTED

You have removed "cursor" from 'viewoptions'. See the recommended setting
under |vim-stay-viewoptions|.


MY FOLD STATE IS NOT PERSISTED / MY CURSOR ENDS UP IN A CLOSED FOLD

You have removed "folds" from 'viewoptions'. See the recommended setting
under |vim-stay-viewoptions|.


MY BUFFER-LOCAL OPTIONS ARE NOT PERSISTED

This is by design: restoring local options from view session files causes hard
to track issues with both Vim features and other plug-ins. Because of this,
starting from version 1.4, vim-stay will ignore the `options` flag in
'viewoptions' when creating views.


MY STATE IS NOT PERSISTED WHEN SWITCHING BETWEEN WINDOWS AND OTHER OSes

With the default settings, 'viewoptions' uses platform specific path
separators, which means stored view sessions are not portable. See the
recommended setting under |vim-stay-viewoptions|.


MY CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY / MY ARGLIST CHANGES WHEN OPENING A FILE

vim-stay uses |mkview| and |loadview|, which persist the local arglist and
local working directory. This can be a bit disorienting at first, but it is by
(Vim's) design. If this really irks you, you may be able to work around it
using vim-stay's autocommand API (see |vim-stay-autocommands|).

For an example, see

	https://github.com/kopischke/vim-stay/issues/10#issuecomment-83691770.


MY MODELINES DO NOT SEEM TO TAKE EFFECT /
THE VIM-AIRLINE STATUSLINE IS WRONG AFTER SWITCHING BUFFERS /
PLUG-INS ACT UP AFTER SWITCHING WINDOWS /
VIM-STAY MESSES UP OPTION X

Your 'viewoptions' include or did include the default `options` (or
`localoptions`) flag, which means all buffer options get stored in the view
session files created by vim-stay. Loading such a view session file has a lot
of unpleasant side effects, hence the recommended |vim-stay-viewoptions| which
do not include the flag.

Starting from version 1.4, vim-stay temporarily removes the `options`and
`localoptions` flag from 'viewoptions' when creating views. However, view
session files created with the incorrect settings (either by earlier versions
of vim-stay, or manually via |:mkview|) will only be updated when vim-stay
re-writes them, and thus still cause issues on first load. If you would rather
start with a fresh slate, you can wipe your 'viewdir' with |:CleanViewdir|.
Note that you will lose all view state doing so.


VIM-STAY TRIES TO PERSIST STATE FOR TEMPORARY FILES

- If the files are in a standard system temporary location, you should check
  if it listed in 'backupskip' - vim-stay will ignore files in the hierarchy
  of directories listed there.
- Files in a temporary or cache directory not listed in 'backupskip' are not
  recognized as volatile, unless their 'buftype' is set to a non-file type.
  You can alleviate the issue by setting |b:stay_ignore| in affected buffers.

Note: for performance reasons, 'backupskip' checking is skipped if Vim is
compiled without |+wildignore| and |glob2regpat()| is not available.


VIM-STAY TRIES TO PERSIST STATE FOR OTHER VOLATILE FILES

Check if the 'filetype' of the affected file is listed in |g:volatile_ftypes|
and try adding it if it is not. I'd also be grateful if you reported the file
type by opening a support issue (or even better, a PR) at

	https://github.com/zhimsel/vim-stay/issues


VIM-STAY SAYS IT CANNOT READ / WRITE THE VIEW FILE

You might have opened the file triggering this with elevated privileges before
(e.g. using `sudo` on Unix). This will result in the view session file created
by vim-stay having elevated privileges too, thus not being writable at a lower
privilege level. Try cleaning your 'viewdir' with a suitable OS tool operating
at the necessary privilege level.


MY VIEW DIRECTORY IS A FESTERING MESS

That is a consequence of Vim's view session design. To quote |loadview|:
"You might want to clean up your 'viewdir' directory now and then."
Use the |:CleanViewdir| command to do exactly that.


MY PROBLEM ISN'T LISTED HERE

You might have found a bug. Please open an issue at

	https://github.com/zhimsel/vim-stay/issues

Please do not forget to list the steps to reproduce the issue as well as your
Vim version and platform.
