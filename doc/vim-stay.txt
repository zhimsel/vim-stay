==============================================================================
1. Introduction					*vim-stay-introduction*

vim-stay adds automated |View| creation and restoration whenever editing
a buffer, across Vim sessions and window life cycles. It also alleviates Vim's
tendency to lose view state when cycling through buffers (via |argdo|, |bufdo|
et al.). It is smart about which buffers should be persisted and which should
not, making the procedure painless and invisible.

==============================================================================
2. Configuration				*vim-stay-configuration*


VIEW SESSION CONFIGURATION:			*vim-stay-viewoptions*

The following, non-standard 'viewoptions' settings are recommended:
>
	set vieoptions=cursor,folds,slash,unix
<

IGNORED FILE TYPES:				*g:volatile_ftypes*

vim-stay applies heuristics to detect volatile file types, but certain file
types escape these and need to be expressly marked as volatile (meaning
buffers of this file type will never be persisted).

Volatile file types are stored in the `volatile_ftypes` global List. To
overwrite this list, do
>
	let g:volatile_ftypes = ['foo', 'bar']
<
any time before or after the plug-in has loaded. To add to this list without
overwriting the defaults, make sure the plug-in has loaded, then do
>
	let g:volatile_ftypes += ['foo', 'bar']
<

3. Integration					*vim-stay-integration*


INTEGRATION WITH 3RD PARTY PLUG-INS:

Out of the box, vim-stay integrates with the following plug-ins:

1. vim-stay	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5089

If you'd like vim-stay to integrate with other position-setting plug-ins, open
an issue or a PR at

    https://github.com/kopischke/vim-stay/issues


INTEGRATION API:

1. Keeping the position set by other scripts	*b:stay_atpos*

To make vim-stay respect a position set by an unsupported script or plug-in,
set the `stay_atpos` buffer-local variable:
>
	let b:stay_atpos = [lnum, colnum]
<
This position will be restored after loading the session.

2. Ignoring a file on a per-buffer basis	*b:stay_ignore*

To stop vim-stay making and restoring sessions for a specific buffer, do
>
	let b:stay_ignore = 1
<
See the |g:volatile_ftypes| user setting for a way to ignore all buffers of
a certain file type.

==============================================================================
4. Troubleshooting			*vim-stay-troubleshooting*


MY FOLD STATE IS NOT PERSISTED / MY CURSOR ENDS UP IN A CLOSED FOLD

You have removed "folds" 'from 'viewoptions'. See the recommended setting
above (|vim-stay-viewoptions|).


MY STATE IS NOT PERSISTED WHEN SWITCHING BETWEEN WINDOWS AND OTHER OS'

With the default settings, 'viewoptions' uses platform specific path
separators, which means stored view sessions are not portable. See the
recommended setting above (|vim-stay-viewoptions|).


MY CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY / MY ARGLIST CHANGES WHEN OPENING A FILE

vim-stay uses |mkview| and |loadview|, which persist the local arglist and
local working directory. This can be a bit disorienting at first, but it is by
(Vim's) design.


VIM-STAY TRIES TO PERSIST STATE FOR TEMPORARY FILES

Files in a temporary or cache directory are not recognized as volatile, unless
their 'buftype' is set to a non-file type, as there is no way to reliably and
portably detect which paths denote temporary state (see |tempfile| just for
the platform specific differences in Vim's internal temporary file usage, and
this doesn't account for things like OS specific cache directories). You can
alleviate the issue by setting |b:stay_ignore| in affected buffers.


VIM-STAY TRIES TO PERSIST STATE FOR OTHER VOLATILE FILES

Check if the 'filetype' of the affected file is listed in |g:volatile_ftypes|
and try adding it if it is not. I'd also be grateful if you reported the file
type by opening a support issue (or even better, a PR) at

	https://github.com/kopischke/vim-stay/issues


MY VIEW DIRECTORY IS A FESTERING MESS

That is a consequence of Vim's view session design. To quote |loadview|:
"You might want to clean up your 'viewdir' directory now and then."


MY PROBLEM ISN'T LISTED HERE

You might have found a bug. Please open an issue at

	https://github.com/kopischke/vim-stay/issues

Please do not forget to list the steps to reproduce the issue as well as your
Vim version and platform.
